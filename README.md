# SensorDataExtraction_RaspberryPi-
There are several critical machines or expensive equipmentâ€™s which suffer damages due to vibrations and temperature. In such a case, a vibration and temperature sensor is required to find out whether the machine or equipment is producing vibrations, temperature or not. Identifying the object which is continuously vibrating is not a tricky job if the proper sensor is used to detect the vibration, temperature and humidity. So in this project, a basic vibration sensor module ADXL345 and DTH 11 sensor module is interface with Raspberry Pi 3+.
